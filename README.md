Web app for NASA Space App Challange

This is an open source web aplication developed by the team Shobolinsky for the nasa Space App Challange 2023. It is a pyhton based application, which uses satelite data from NASA to shoq current wildfires nearly real time (20-30 minutes of delay). It has also a user interface with every necessary feature, like creating nwe user, login and logout pages. A user can also report current wildfires in his 5 km area (which is calculated based on the users IP address). A feature which is in developement stages makes possible for other users to react for user-reported wildfires (with a positive, IS THERE, or a  negative, IT IS NOT THERE, report). 

The application has also a news feed, which diplays all of the current wildfire related news form the internet, this is made with API.

A very important target of the project is raising social awareness. We tried to achieve this with a lot of visually interesting features, like informative slides or fire seafty prospect.
